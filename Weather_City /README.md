## Key Concepts Used
- API integration
- HTTP requests
- JSON data handling
- User input handling
- Error handling (basic)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Requests library
- Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

## How It Works
1. User enters a city name
2. The program sends a request to the weather API
3. The API returns weather data in JSON format
4. The app extracts and displays required information
